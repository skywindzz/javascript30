    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; //this is array reference not a copy
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'luke';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players[3]);
    console.log(team[3]);
    // now here is the problem!
    //player 3 become luke too!!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); // this will create a copy of player array, slice() will return the whole array
    //or
    
    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team 3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
     const person = { name: 'tony', age: 30 };
    // with Objects
    const cap = person;
     // if you do cap.number = 99; then person will also have that number: 99 prop
    
    // and think we make a copy:
    
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});
    console.log(cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    //one level deep means if will only get to name and age but object within an object such as social will still be referenced.!!
    const tony = { 
      name: 'tony',
      age: 30,
      social: {
        twitter: '@tony',
        facebook: 'tony.developer'
      }
    }

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    //a way for deep clone but has performance issues
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
